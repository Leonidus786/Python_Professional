# declaring a variable in python is super easy :-

x = 5

y = "Sandeep"

z = True


# to get address of  variable use -- id()

# print(id(x))

# print(id(y))

# print(id(z))

# to know the type of data stored in a variable.

# print(type(x))

# print(type(y))

# print(type(z))


age = 26

Age = 31

AGE = 30


# print(id(age))

# print(id(Age))

# print(id(AGE))


w = "hello"

s = "amit"



g = w +" "+ s

print(g)




# x = 20

# print(x)



# print(x+6)


# print(x)

# 10u = 5

# _10u = 5

# print(_10u)
